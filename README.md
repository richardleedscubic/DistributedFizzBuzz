# DistributedFizzBuzz
For AFC House Coding Dojo, 21 Nov 2019

## Objective: Practise distributed TDD

We'll work in pairs, each pair taking on part of the classic FizzBuzz exercise:

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For
numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print "FizzBuzz".

Sample output:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
... etc up to 100
